## ⚙️ Pre‑installed Utilities

uTPro comes with a curated set of utilities and best practices already integrated, so you can start building immediately:

- **Database flexibility** — Runs on **PostgreSQL** (default), **SQL Server**, or **SQLite**. Switch engines by changing just two `ConnectionStrings` keys in `appsettings.json` — no code changes. See [4.8 Database Provider](docs/4.-Configurations.md#48-database-provider-postgresql--sql-server--sqlite).  
- **Pre‑configured build scripts** (minification, bundling, cache‑busting).  
- **SEO‑friendly meta setup** and Open Graph defaults.  
- **Accessibility helpers** to ensure inclusive design.
- **Performance optimizations** (lazy loading, async scripts, caching hints).
- **Sample components** (navigation, footer, hero section) ready to customize.

**With the support of extensions:** [UmbracoSeoVisualizer](https://marketplace.umbraco.com/package/umbracoseovisualizer), [Umbraco.Community.BlockPreview](https://marketplace.umbraco.com/package/umbraco.community.blockpreview), [uSync](https://marketplace.umbraco.com/package/usync), [WebMarkupMin.AspNetCoreLatest](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WebMarkupMin.AspNetCoreLatest/), [LigerShark.WebOptimizer.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LigerShark.WebOptimizer.Core)...

- **Feature** — Optional pluggable features (form builder, file manager, audit log, etc.)
- **Project** — Main web application and configuration
